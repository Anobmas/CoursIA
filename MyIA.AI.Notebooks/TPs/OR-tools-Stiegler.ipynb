    "# The Stigler Diet Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we show how to solve a classic problem called the Stigler diet, named for economics Nobel laureate George Stigler, who computed an inexpensive way to fulfill basic nutritional needs given a set of foods. He posed this as a mathematical exercise , not as eating recommendations, although the notion of computing optimal nutrition has of come into vogue recently.\n",
